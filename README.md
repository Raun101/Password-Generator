⚠️ Antivirus & SmartScreen Notice
Some antivirus programs or Windows SmartScreen may flag this app as suspicious because it is packaged as a standalone .exe using PyInstaller. This is a false positive — the app contains no malicious code and is safe to use.
If you're concerned, you can:
- Scan the file using VirusTotal
- Review the source code included in this repository
- Run the app from within the extracted folder to reduce AV triggers
This behavior is common for small, unsigned apps. A signed version may be provided in future releases.
